0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
We are building a web application where people can book a temporary apartment. Everything in Python is an object, which implies that they are an instance of a certain class. So, every entity in our Airbnb web application, including a person or people who want to book an apartment using this web application we are building in Python will be represented as an instance of a certain class in the database. An instance (object) of the User class in our database represents an individual who has created an account on this web app and contains relevant information such as name, email, and password. then an instance (object) of the class State represents a state or province, while an instance of the class City represents a city within that state, there will also have an instance of the class Place that represents a temporary room or suite available for booking on the web app and contains relevant information such as its name, description, location, price, and availability dates.
